# Regular Usage (By Typesetters and Editors)

## Logging in

Typically a user is added to the system by another user.
The new user is sent a link allowing them to choose a password for the site.
If a new user has not visited the site yet, or has not chosen to be remembered between visits, they will need to login in (and possibly choose what project to log in to) when first visiting the page.
This is done though a typical username/login form.
There is now a button that allows a user to be remembered indefinitely by the site on a given device.
Forgotten passwords can also be reset for existing users.

## Top Navigation and User Maintenance

After logging in, there are four buttons near the top of the page which navigate between main parts of the framework.
The "current" and "archived" buttons will show the documents currently being worked on, and those that have been archived, respectively.
More on using those below.

The "my details" button allows each site user (typesetter or editor) to change their name or email, or request a change in their password.
These should be self-explanatory.
The "users" button can be used to add or remove users from the site.
Any one with access to the framework can invite other users or remove them, so be judicious about who is given access to the framework itself.

There is also a toggle in the top banner for switching between dark and light mode.
This is a purely aesthetic choice.

## Typesetting Workflow

The "current" page show a listing of typesetting assignments or documents.

A new document listing can be created by clicking the appropriate “add new …” button for the type of document/assignment.
(For more on configuring document types, see the [configuration](https://github.com/frabjous/open-guide-typesetting-framework/blob/main/doc/configuration.md) documentation.)

The first step after clicking this button is to fill in the document id field in the top left of the new listing.
This can be anything unique to the document, a number, identifier, or even a short title so long as it consists only of letters and digits.
A document id must be assigned before any other work on the individual document/typesetting assignment can be saved.

Each listing consists of six collapsible/expandable parts: "**Metadata**", "**Uploads**", "**Bibliography**", "**Edit document**", "**Proofs**", "**Publication**".
A typical typesetting job would go through each of these parts in the sequence in which they are listed.
Each part is discussed in more detail below.



## Archiving and Unarchiving Documents

Documents no longer being worked on can be archived by clicking the archive button on the top right of each listing.
They will still be available under the "archived" and can be "unarchived" in a similar manner.
Proofs can only be viewed for current documents, but even old proof sets will become available again if a project is unarchived.
The main purpose of archiving is simply to make it easier to find the currently relevant documents.
